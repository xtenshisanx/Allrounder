**Allrounder Custom Rotation for ExileBuddy**

Hey Everyboddy,
this custom rotation is designed and written by xTenshiSanx (me).
It provides a generic and individual combatrotation for everybody without changing anything directly in the code.
The best is so nobody could destroy the code accidentally.

**Install**

Just Download these Github and Unzip it in your Exilebuddy folder.
After the first start with the character of your choise the bot will autocreate a template file for your char

**Rotation Config**
